*Make builder properly regard the bind pose skeleton. Let multiple animations be retargeted to the same skeleton.
*Animation track definition structure and separation from skeleton bone count
*Removal of RIDs from Anim::animation_controller
*Fix Anim::animation controller_memory leak
*Bone selection entity selection
*Motion matching for multiple entities
*Sampling based MM info generation
*MM search optimization
*MM trajectory structure
*MM trajectory following
*MM trajectory creation tools
*Joystick support
*Animation mirroring in Anim::animation_state
*RID management for animations
*MM profile saving in a MMSet build agnostic way (might need one per MMSet)
*Current frame bone velocity calculation
*Entity separation from Anim::animation_controller (no pointer in entity)

*Unified Timeline Window template for UI with tick markers and scrooll to zoom in
*Only reload assets after they have not been written to for some time (currently large models often update only partially)

*Frustum culling when rendering
*Sort mesh instances when rendering
*Fix SSAO
*Fix tone mapping (currently colores are washed out and output is affected by FXAA)
*Make FXAA work correctly with tonemapping (drop the assumption that inputs fall int [0, 1] range)
*Bloom is very slow and poor quality!!
*Nonlinear depth of filed (+bokeh)
*Separate entity UI from Physics UI (clean it up)
*Rendering with multiple lights !!!
*Spot lights

*Multithreaded job system !!!

*Better text solution !!!
*More efficient file system update

*Split Anim::transform from the one used by entities and game logic
*Add hierarchical memory management
*Add memory usage visualization
*Remove dependence on static memory (make system singletons allocate it explicitly)
*Make UI not be rendered via debug drawing facilities
*Interactive gizmos
*Measure ms instead of cycles in profiler !!!
*non performance heavy GPU profiling
*Hierarchical GPU profiling
*GPU profile UI synchronized with CPU
*Clean up profiling code (maybe put into a singleton)
*Group support for profiling (visualization as well)
*Multithreading
*Bounding box limited UI button text
*One or few unified APIs for framebuffer generation

*Shader includes
*Fix preview opacity
*Add world independent controllable lights for preview
*Change cubemap
*Unified cubemap/environment map support

*Trck down compilation slowdown causes
*Builder animation framerate subsampling
*Builder empty/repeated track removal
*Builder desired frame removal (or just 1-st as it stores bindpose in the CMU dataset)

*Fix invallid RID issues when selecting the empty element of a combo box
*Add animation timeline
*MM Animation editing tools
*MM cost function visualization UI
*Add instancing for debug drawing
*Make the resource_hash_table an actual hash table!
*Replace all printfs with a DEBUG_LOG macro for easy disabling and integration with internal console
